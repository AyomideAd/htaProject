    <h1>Chapter One</h1>
    <h2>London <sub>1848</sub> </h2>
    <h3>Winter<sup>1</sup></h3>
    <p>Win had always thought Kev Merripen was beautiful, in the way landscape or a wintry day could be beautiful. He was a large striking man, uncompromising in every angle. The exotic boldness of his features was a perfect setting for eyes so dark that the irises were barely distinguishable from the pupil. His hair was thick and as a raven's wing, his brow strong and straight. And his wide mouth was set with a perpetully brooding curve that Win found irrestible. </p> <hr>
    <p>Merripen. Her love, but never her lover. They had known each other since childhood, when he had been taken in by her family. Although the Hathaways had always treated him as one of their own, Merripen had acted in the capacity of a servant, A protector, An outsider.</p> <hr>
    <p><strong><u><i>Win would not accept such a fate.</i></u></strong></p>
    <p>She longed to get well, to enjoy the things that most people took for granted. To dance, laugh, walk through the countryside. She wanted the freedom to love... to marry... to have her own family someday.</p>
